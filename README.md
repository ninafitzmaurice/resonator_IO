TODO: 

BRF_io: 
divergence boundary
sound: toggle spikes or oscillations
surrogate gradient

spike train inputs - set % of random neurons to get input
test different spike freq inputs? need a smart way to do systematically
add distant dependent decay? 

GUI:
toggle on/off plotting adaptive threshold
