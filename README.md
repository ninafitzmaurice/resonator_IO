TODO: 

BRF_io: 
divergence boundary?? tbh nah 
sound: toggle spikes or oscillations or off
surrogate gradient

LATER NOT IMPORTANT
spike train inputs - set % of random neurons to get input
test different spike freq inputs? need a smart way to do systematically
add distant dependent decay? 

GUI:
toggle on/off plotting adaptive threshold 


TO THINK:
how am I gonna implement into the wider microcircuit
1. without surrogate gradient
2. with surrogate gradient
